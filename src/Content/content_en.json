  "intro_paragraph_1": "As a student of IT-product development, I am skilled in developing and designing physical products that incorporate digital technology. With a focus on creating user-friendly products, I have a deep understanding of user experience and user interface design principles that I incorporate into my work.",
  "intro_paragraph_2": "I am proficient in programming languages such as Java and JavaScript, and I have experience working with databases, APIs, and frameworks, as well as with getting ChatGPT to write my CV intro. As a team player, I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve project goals, and I am committed to continuous learning and improvement in my field.",

  "spaceship_title": "Spaceship toy",
  "spaceship_paragraph_1": "The spaceship toy was our project for the course Physical Computing, which was focused on using sensors and actuators to make a toy of our own design. We elected to make a spaceship which could lower its wings when landing, as well as fire a projectile the the flashing LEDs were fully engaged. The ship was built of a combination of 3D-printed and laser cut parts, and was controlled by an Atmega328p microcontroller.",
  "spaceship_paragraph_2": "While the electrical and programmatical parts of the project weren't particularly complex compared to other projects, we learned to see the value of rapid prototyping and properly planning in advance. During the project we put off the design of the mechanical innards of the rocket until the very end, which resulted in us having to put in a lot of extra work hours in the final week to make the product work in time.",

  "KLS_title": "KLS",
  "KLS_paragraph_1": "The K-nearest-neighbour Learning System was our product for the IT Product Design Project course, in which our case was to teach gymnasium students about machine learning. As the name implies we chose the K-nearest-neighbour algorithm, because of its relative simplicity."
